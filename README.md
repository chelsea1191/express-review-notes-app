# Express Review

- npm i
- nodemon server -e js

This application is partially built. The front end is completely built but the express backend is only partially built.

Note - you shouldn't have to modify anything in the index.html file.

Examine the back end routes that the front end is looking for.

Since this a CRUD app you will be looking for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

This front end is also looking for a styles.css in the assets folder. In order for your front end to access this file, you'll need a route for that as well. (Hint - express static route)

Consider having your backend api calls in their own file by using an express router.
